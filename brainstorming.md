# Group 6 App Brainstorming

Ideas:

Agrika:
1) "Notebook" app for studying/distraction-free activities - gamification can be added to encourage user to not leave app and keep a "streak" of time. Notes in the form of lists/blank pages/agendas can be added with headers. (using database). Can have a login to build habit (social encouragement), people can share their notes/audio/pics. (Add on: may be able to go live to study with others)
2) Invisalign inspired app - track daily retainer/tray hours with regular reminders when they are off. (This would use a pane/bottom navigation bar) When a day has less than min. of 20 hours of wear, add 2 more days to wear current tray/retainer set (default; can be changed).
3) Reverse image search app off the Internet/other apps. Currently, it is used in search bars but could be an app to find pics - It is one of the creative app ideas, in which a user just has to click a picture of the product and search it online to purchase it. (May be able to take a picture of product in reality and find it online this way as well)

Albert:
1) Spending tracker app - track how much you spend in a given period and on what items. Can be used to keep a budget or look for anomalies in spending habits.
2) Ad blocker app - Blocks all links to not only advertisements, but anything malicious as well. Can also bypass ad blocker prompts.
3) Monochrome app - At a certain time of the day (set by the user), display is set to monochromatic. Useful at night when the user needs to sleep.


Jessica: 
1) Habit building app - calendar functionality, set stopwatch and record hours spent, earn points the longer a habit is maintained, set yearly/quarterly goals, review habit analytics over time, receive daily notifications (user sets time) to work on habit
2) Health/Nutrition app - multiple tabs, can customize areas to focus on (exercise, diet) 
3) Study app - get matched 1:1 with students at similar knowledge level for same subject
4) Reading app - Take screenshot and turn to text, save snapshots in library

Kamden:
1) Toursit app that tells you interesting things to do in an area and notifies you if you are close to a POI
2) app/service subscription organizer - keep track of and manage subscriptions like netflix. user can cancel or make changes through the app
3) recipe book app - download and save recipes from the internet. create and store your own recipes. create a shopping list of necessary ingredients. provide recipe suggestions.

2. Mobile Wallet App (Combination of Albert's idea #1 and Kamden's idea #2)
3. Reverse Image Search App

## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
1. Study App
   - **Description**: An app to facilitate distraction-free studying and provide a learning community for various interest groups
   - **Category:** Education/Social
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for the instant logging of student behavior. Students use the app to purchase goods from the student store and other rewards (using points accumulated via gamification). The camera is used to share images with parents.
   - **Story:** Bring together students with common interests and encourage users to study consistently and share their learning process
   - **Market:** Students in highschool/college
   - **Habit:** Add daily "streaks" feature and reward points the more often and consistently students login. Students earn points by contributing to community by posting original content.
   - **Scope:** Daily feed/bulletin board (photos and text), login tracker. (Possible Add-ons: live meeting, student matching). 

2. Mobile Wallet App
   - **Description**: Allows users to track spending and purchases. Users can manage and organize their subscriptions, see how often they are spending money and on what. Can set budgets over a set period of time like weekly/monthly/annually. User could track how much money they save.
   - **Category:** Financial
   - **Mobile:** Mobile lets users log purchases while they are out at shops/restaurants. People frequently use a mobile app for their bank so it could be convenient to keep financial apps on the same device. Push notifications could alert users if they spend too much.
   - **Story:** Allows users to be mindful of what they spend their money on and how often. Can reinforce good spending habits somehow?
   - **Market:** Individuals who overspend or like to keep better track of their spending. Also, individuals who are forgetful and need reminders for subscriptions for cancellations or payments.
   - **Habit:** Users would use their app throughout a day/week as they spend money. Reminders for users to log purchases if they haven't in a while. Login tracking
   - **Scope:** Budget maker. Spending analysis. Subscription Organizer.
   
3. Reverse Image Search App
    - **Description:** An app that lets users upload or take a picture of an object, and then provide online store links to that object so it can be purchased.
    - **Category:** Lifestyle
    - **Mobile:** Mobile is useful for users who wish to find an item to purchase using just an image (off their gallery/phone/camera).The result would be redirecting the users to links/possible sources.
    - **Story:** Creative application that can safely receive images to reverse search without storage of upload (more secure/credible). 
    - **Market:** Users of all ages and gender would use this application. Entrepreneurs can also tie up with sellers and other retailers for generating more profits. 
    - **Habit:** Users will use the app as frequently as they encounter new items/images - visual version of "Shazam" music app.
    - **Scope:**
