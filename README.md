## Overview

### Description

An app to facilitate distraction-free studying and provide a learning community for various interest groups.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Education/Social
- **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for the instant logging of student behavior. Students use the app to purchase goods from the student store and other rewards (using points accumulated via gamification). The camera is used to share images with parents.
- **Story:** Bring together students with common interests and encourage users to study consistently and share their learning process
- **Market:** Students in highschool/college
- **Habit:** Add daily "streaks" feature and reward points the more often and consistently students login. Students earn points by contributing to community by posting original content.
- **Scope:** Daily feed/bulletin board (photos and text), login tracker. (Possible Add-ons: live meeting, student matching).

## Product Spec

### 1. User Features (Required and Optional)

**Required Features**

* User login
* Make notes in the form of lists/pages/agendas that are stored locally
* Share notes/audio/pictures
* Login streak counter
* Dashboard for gamification - Agrika's "gardening" idea (up for discussion): empty clear terrarium in dashboard tab; when user accumulates points, can purchase seeds from store to personalize terrarium; in order for the seeds to further sprout and grow/maintain as adults in terrarium, more points required/taken from streaks/hours. Being inactive for too long= plants killed/die over time.

* Match with students so you can study together
